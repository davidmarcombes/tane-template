<!-- This page uses the `llm` layout to generate a plain text `llm.txt` at the
root of the built site. It pulls site metadata from `src/_data/site.json` and
navigation from `src/_data/navigation.json`. -->

## About this file

Add a concise summary of the site here for Large Language Model (LLM)
consumption. When you build the site this markdown will be rendered and
included in the generated `/llm.txt` alongside site metadata and a list of
pages and posts.

Example:

This website showcases the company's product offerings and blog. Primary
audience: marketing teams and product managers. Key features: fast static
site, accessible components, multilingual support.

Make sure to keep this summary short and up-to-date; it is intended to give an
LLM a high-level overview of the site when performing tasks like content
generation, SEO guidance, or website analysis.
